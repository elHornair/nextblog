If you ever went on a longer bicycle trip, you probably used a navigation app like
[Maps.me](https://maps.me/),
[Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/) or
[MapOut](https://mapout.app/)
to plan your route and find your way in unknown territory. These apps feel like magic! They know:

* If there is a road between town A and B
* Every curve and incline the road has
* If the road is paved, unpaved, rideable by bicycle
* How long it takes you to ride from A to B
* That there is a bakery waiting for your in town B with some delicious croissants

How do they know all of this? Sadly there is no magic involved. These apps get all this information
out of a huge database called [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). What's special about OpenStreetMap is
that it's a free and collaborative project. That means that the aforementioned information is gathered by people like
you and me and put into the database. Then everyone can use that data for free.

This is very different from the commercial mapping services of
[Apple](https://www.apple.com/maps/) and [Google](https://www.google.com/maps), which are based on their own proprietary
data. These companies gather (and buy) the mapping data themselves. We are not allowed to use the data without
their permission.

I personally find it remarkable that a collaborative project can keep up with the respective products of some of the
biggest companies in the world. But it goes without saying, that this is only possible, because a lot of people put in
a lot of free work to keep it running. After years of using OpenStreetMap, I've recently made my first contribution
to it. I've [documented my learnings](/adding-a-missing-road-to-open-street-map), so you can do it too!
